## What is Docker?
Docker is an open-source platform designed to automate the deployment of applications inside lightweight, portable containers. Containers package an application and its dependencies, ensuring consistency across different environments.

---

## Why Use Docker?
- **Portability**: Run applications consistently across development, testing, and production environments.
- **Efficiency**: Lightweight containers use fewer resources compared to virtual machines.
- **Scalability**: Easily scale applications horizontally by deploying multiple containers.
- **Isolation**: Containers isolate applications, ensuring minimal interference between them.

---

## Key Docker Concepts
- **Images**: Read-only templates used to create containers.
- **Containers**: Running instances of Docker images.
- **Dockerfile**: A script defining how to build a Docker image.
- **Docker Hub**: A cloud-based registry for sharing Docker images.
- **Volumes**: Persistent storage for containers.

---

## Getting Started with Docker
1. **Install Docker**: Download and install Docker from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/).
2. **Run Your First Container**:
    ```bash
    docker run hello-world
    ```
3. **Explore Docker CLI**: Familiarize yourself with Docker commands.

---

## Basic Docker Commands
- **Run a container**:
  ```bash
  docker run <image-name>
  ```
- **List running containers**:
  ```bash
  docker ps
  ```
- **Stop a container**:
  ```bash
  docker stop <container-id>
  ```
- **Remove a container**:
  ```bash
  docker rm <container-id>
  ```
- **Build an image**:
  ```bash
  docker build -t <image-name> .
  ```
