## What Can GitHub Actions Do?

1. **Run Tests Automatically**  
    Imagine baking cookies and wanting to ensure they taste good before sharing. GitHub Actions "taste tests" your code by running checks to ensure everything works.

2. **Deploy Your Code**  
    When your code is ready, GitHub Actions can help you publish it to a website or app with minimal effort.

3. **Save Time**  
    By handling repetitive tasks, GitHub Actions frees you up to focus on creating amazing things.

## How Does It Work?

1. **Workflows**  
    A workflow is like a to-do list for GitHub Actions. You define what it should do and when.

2. **Triggers**  
    Triggers are events that tell GitHub Actions to start working. For example, uploading new code can trigger automatic testing.

3. **Jobs and Steps**  
    - **Jobs** are big tasks.  
    - **Steps** are the smaller actions needed to complete those tasks.  
      Example:  
      - **Job**: Bake cookies.  
      - **Steps**: Mix ingredients → Bake in the oven → Let them cool.
