## Key Security Features

### 1. **Single Sign-On (SSO)**  
SSO is like having a universal remote for your apps. Instead of juggling multiple passwords, you log in once and unlock everything you need. Easy peasy!

**Real-World Scenario:**  
Imagine you’re at work, juggling emails, project tools, and cloud files. With Okta’s SSO, you log in once, and it’s like opening a treasure chest—all your tools are ready to go!

### 2. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**  
MFA is your digital fortress. Even if someone cracks your password, they’ll hit a second wall—like a code sent to your phone or a fingerprint scan.

**Real-World Scenario:**  
You’re shopping online, and a hacker tries to sneak into your account. Thanks to MFA, they’re stopped cold without the secret code. Your account stays safe, and you keep shopping stress-free!

### 3. **Lifecycle Management**  
Okta is like the ultimate organizer for access permissions. It ensures employees get the right tools when they join and lose access when they leave—no loose ends!

**Real-World Scenario:**  
You start a new job, and on day one, you’re ready to roll with access to all the apps you need. When you leave, Okta locks the doors behind you, keeping company data secure.

### 4. **Adaptive Security**  
Okta is like a security system with a brain. It adjusts based on your behavior—making things smooth when everything looks normal and extra cautious when something seems fishy.

**Real-World Scenario:**  
You’re on vacation abroad and try logging into your work account. Okta notices the unusual location and asks for extra proof it’s really you. It’s like having a super-smart friend watching your back!

### 5. **API Security**  
APIs are the secret passageways apps use to talk to each other. Okta secures these tunnels, keeping hackers out and your data safe.

**Real-World Scenario:**  
Your food delivery app chats with your bank to process payments. Okta ensures this conversation stays private, so your money doesn’t end up in the wrong hands.
