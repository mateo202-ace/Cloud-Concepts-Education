## üîí **Key Security Features of Okta**

### 1. **Single Sign-On (SSO)**
SSO simplifies access by allowing users to log in once and gain access to multiple applications securely. No more juggling passwords!

**Real-World Scenario:**  
Imagine a marketing team accessing tools like Google Workspace, Slack, and HubSpot. With Okta SSO, they log in once and seamlessly switch between apps, saving time and reducing password-related risks.

---

### 2. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
MFA adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to verify their identity using multiple methods (e.g., SMS, biometrics, or authenticator apps).

**Real-World Scenario:**  
A financial institution uses MFA to protect sensitive customer data. Employees must verify their identity with a fingerprint scan and a one-time code before accessing critical systems.

### 3. **Lifecycle Management**
Automate user provisioning and deprovisioning to ensure employees have access to the right tools at the right time.

**Real-World Scenario:**  
When a new hire joins a tech company, Okta automatically grants access to relevant tools like Jira, GitHub, and Zoom. When they leave, access is revoked instantly, reducing security risks.

### 4. **Adaptive Authentication**
Okta uses AI-driven insights to assess login risks and enforce dynamic security measures based on user behavior.

**Real-World Scenario:**  
A global enterprise detects unusual login attempts from a foreign country. Okta flags the activity and prompts additional verification, preventing unauthorized access.

---

### 5. **API Security**
Okta secures APIs by managing access tokens and ensuring only authorized users can interact with backend systems.

**Real-World Scenario:**  
A healthcare provider uses Okta to secure APIs that connect patient portals to medical databases, ensuring sensitive health data remains protected.
